# Security-Case-Study

In late 2023, Mercedes-Benz experienced a significant security breach involving the inadvertent exposure of sensitive internal source code. 
The breach, spanning from September 29, 2023, to January 24, 2024, was discovered by cybersecurity researchers at RedHunt Labs. 
The root cause of the incident was a mishandled GitHub token, which allowed unauthorized access to critical intellectual property, including database connections, design blueprints, and API keys. 
Despite Mercedes-Benz's swift actions to revoke the token and remove the exposed repository, the breach highlighted serious vulnerabilities and raised concerns about the extent of unauthorized access and potential exploitation.This case study delves into the incident, its repercussions, and the broader implications for cybersecurity within the automotive industry.
